# Cyclistic Bikes Analysis

## Introduction

In completing the Google Data Analytics Certification, I helped Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company based in Chicago, with data-driven strategies to: convert casual riders into annual members.



## Problem statement
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?


## Skills/ concepts demonstrated:
- Excel Data Cleaning
- SQL Scripting
- Tableau

## Analysis

I found that member riders made more trips than casual riders, with 2.45 million versus 1.63 million trips. However, casual riders had nearly double the average ride duration compared to members. Both rider types exhibited seasonality, with ride counts peaking in May, dipping slightly in June, and then rising again before returning to early-year levels. Member rides were consistently high on weekdays and lower on weekends, while casual rides were the opposite, peaking on weekends. Member rides had two daily peaks, aligning with typical work hours, while casual rides peaked in the late afternoon, matching recreational times. Only casual riders used docked bikes, while both member and casual riders used classic and electric bikes. Location data revealed that member rides originated and ended at stations away from the Lake Michigan coast, indicating diverse travel patterns. In contrast, casual riders primarily used stations along the narrow coastal strip, suggesting a focus on leisure activities near the coast.


## Conclusion and Recommendations:
1. Given the seasonal demand for bike rides and the target audience of casual riders, I suggest launching the marketing campaign in the second week of March, two weeks before spring begins.

2. Introduce a discounted weekend-only membership plan, as casual riders tend to take more rides on weekends. This would be an attractive option for many casual riders and could help boost membership and revenue.

3. Distribute a survey to casual riders to gather qualitative data that could provide deeper insights. For instance, why is the average ride length for casual riders nearly double that of member riders? Understanding this could uncover valuable information about their preferences and help in developing strategies to convert them into annual members.
